I started with counting the number of arguments to determine if there were more
than 3 and then I decided to change it to an array. The goal was to be able to
add any additional input with ease without changing much. So, by having
materials in an input array would make it easier to implement without the
function trying to figure out which argument belongs to what.

I decided to build this as a small library that could be used in other
other code. This way it doesn’t care what the UI looks like or how it’s
information is used. This also allowed me to be more strict with inputs/outputs
and not have to handle things like parsing the string “$123.45” to a float.
I’ve never written a node module before so I suspect there are some pieces to
package.json that would be needed to publish this (even if it were published
to a private repo) so that it could be used by npm.
